Sleek Website for an Innovative Digtial Agency
Check Out The Finished Site [Link](https://monsters-and-silk.web.app)

This website is a remake of an existing website https://www.wolfwhale.com/

I believe this site is very mordern, clean, and innovative.

I wanted to recreate a website that:

 - one would make a greate addition to my portfolio
 - two would challenge me to step outside of the style of my previous projects and help expand my knowledge and skill in creating a mordern and beautiful website
 - three would enable me to build a style of site that is more align with the type of development I want to pursue.
 
Challenges

- This site, although seems fairly simple and minimal has a lot going on to make it function as you see
